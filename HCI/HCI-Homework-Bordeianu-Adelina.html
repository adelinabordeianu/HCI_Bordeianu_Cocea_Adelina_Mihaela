                <p> The application has the following functionalities: creating an account which includes
                    a form with multiple fields, some of them referring mostly to the style and preferences
                    that the user has in fashion and color palette, login to the application with an email address
                    and a password, a generator which compose an outfit according to weather, mood and the style which
                    the user wants to approach that day. Another functionalitie is visioning the whole outfit on a
                    mannequin to get an idea of what all the pieces will look like together.
                </p>
                <h3>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
                <p> The application can be used by every person who doesn't have that much
                    time to put together an outfit that will look good and reflect their own
                    personality and mood. It can be used mostly by women because the design
                    is meant to attract the feminine side.
                </p>
                <p> Various personas interacting to the system:</p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Name: Anais Popa</p>
                        <p>Date of birth: 10/25/1980</p>
                        <p>Gender: Female</p>
                        <p>Location: Iasi, Romania</p>
                        <p>Work Place: BRD Bank</p>
                        <p>School: Faculty of economics and business administration</p>


                        <p>Main Points: Anais Popa is a mother who has 3 kids: 2 twin boys and one girl, so she doesn't
                            have the neccesary time to be careful of what she's wearing everytime. At work she needs to
                            wear
                            an office outfit to look professional and clean, but her routine is: she's waking up at 6 am
                            to
                            drink her coffee and do her makeup. After that, at 7 am she needs to wake up her kids to get
                            ready for school and make their breakfast, all of that in 30 minutes so she could get at
                            7:40 at
                            school and then at 8 at the bank. Her experience with clothing in relative the same as every
                            normal person, once a month or even less often she goes at the mall for a shopping spree.
                            Even
                            in that moment she doesn't have enough time for her because she needs to take care for her
                            kids
                            too.</p>

                        <p>Goals:
                            She have never used this kind of application before, so this kind of design and approach
                            sounds
                            good to her. The idea that she can get a full outfit in minutes it'a a saviour. She could
                            get
                            more sleep and organize better.</p>

                        <p>Frustrations and Pain Points:

                            The difficulties that Anais can have are the lack of an article or not feeling satisfied
                            with
                            the outfit and be forced to do all the steps again.</p>

                        <p>Scenarious:

                            It's sunday and Anais needs to go her sister's birthday which is taking place at a pasta
                            restaurant, so she needs to put together a casual outfit yet feminine. Of course, before
                            that
                            she has to get her kids ready and after that maybe she has 5-10 minutes to choose something
                            to
                            wear.
                            But here it comes ReStylist. First she's logs in to the application after that she press the
                            "My
                            style" button and first of all, she sees on the first page that the weather it's sunny,
                            she's
                            choosing the way she feels by an emoji listed on the second page, after that the kind of
                            outfit
                            that she wants to be generated (casual). After all these steps in a few seconds she gets an
                            image with how her outfit should look. If she doesn't have a piece of clothing that appears
                            in
                            the generated outfit she can anytime replace it with something else.</p>

                        <p>Name: Name: Alina Georgescu</p>

                        <p>Work Place: instagram influencer and UI designer</p>
                        <p>School: Faculty of Computer Science</p>


                        <p>Main Points: Alina is a UI Designer who travels 4-8 times each month for work. She has a
                            specific regions in which she travels, and she often visits the same cities and stays at the
                            same hotel. She is frustrated by the fact that no matter how frequently she takes similar
                            trips, she spends hours of her day booking travel and making her luggage, so she looses a
                            lot of time trying to put together outfits for the trip.</p>

                        <p>Goals:
                            She wants to get an outfit for every single day of her trip so she could have more time to
                            visit the city and to focus on her work. She wants comfortable and simple looks that does
                            not require such fancy pieces of clothing. </p>

                        <p>Frustrations and Pain Points:

                            The difficulties that Alina have are the process of choosing what to put in the luggage; she
                            really dislikes that. Also, she spends a lot of money on these trips so she can't afford
                            unique and high-end pieces of clothing.</p>

                        <p>Scenarious:

                            It's summer and it's time for Alina to travel to Paris in France for 5 days. She has an
                            important meeting on the second day, so she needs something feminime and classy but at the
                            same time comfortable because it's really hot. She opens the app and she starts to generate
                            an outfit based on these criteria.

                    The priority of these features is high

                    a call to action button which will redirect them to another page that includes a series of emoji
                    reflecting their mood.
                    After selecting an emoji, the user will be redirected to the next page where is a list of styles
                    that the user would want to approach: casual, sporty,
                    elegant and so on. Finally after completing these 3 steps, the final outfit will be generated and

                To direct users to the customization page I have included a link in the navigation bar and a call to action button in land page.
                Since this is a new concept, after clicking on the call to action button or the link in navigation part, first time, users are redirected
                to a page explaining the core function of the customizer. Existing users are able to log directly to thei account from the loggin button.
                On "My Style" page, after being walked through the highlights of the service, users will have a call to action section that will lead them
